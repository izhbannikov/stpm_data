This is simulation tests for one-dimensional SPM (discrete and continuous).

* Files sim.cont.R, sim.discr.R are used for data simulation.
* Files spm.test.cont.R, spm.test.discr.R are used for model parameters estimation.
* Files final.tables.R and histograms.R are used to generate results: a table and histograms.

Note: due to constant improvement of the package stpm, parameters in functions may be different from those used in these simulation tests.
