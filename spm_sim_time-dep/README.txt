This is simulation tests for one-dimensional SPM with time-dependent coefficients.

* File sim_time-dep.R is used for data simulation.
* File spm.test.time-dep.R is used for model parameters estimation.
* Files final.tables.R and histograms.R are used to generate results: a table and histograms.

Note: due to constant improvement of the package stpm, parameters in functions may be different from those used in these simulation tests.
