This repository contains simulated data and scripts used for the manuscript "stpm: an R-package for Stochastic Process Model"

* Folder spm_sim contains data and scripts for one-dimensional simulation tests.
* Folder spm_sim2 contains data and scripts for two-dimensional simulations tests.
* Folder spm_sim_time-dep contains data and scripts for data simulation using SPM with time-dependent coefficients.

Note: due to constant improvement of the package stpm, parameters in functions may be different from those used in these simulation tests.
